# LinkTree Design

A static LinkTree webpage design made for a course project using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) but this project doesn't use Javascript. It was made only using HTML5 and CSS as a responsive LinkTree homepage.

It was designed by me with citric and warm colors that I think flowed really nice with the project. :)
